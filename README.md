# polymesh-extension
Polymesh chain extension for Ink! Smart contracts.

This is the low-level Ink! ChainExtension for Polymesh.  It is recommended to use
crate `polymesh-api` (with feature `ink`) for an easier to use interface.

See example `examples/extension-tester` to see how to make runtime calls and read storage.
